## Description
**Goal:** The goal of this project aims to prepare, transform, visualize, and analyze data into an interactive dashboard that helps Maven Roasters franchise owners identify trends and opportunities to improve operational efficiency and sales.

**Project Overview:** In this project, sales data from three Maven Roasters locations in Manhattan was collected over six months. Using Microsoft Excel, the data was transformed to highlight relevant information and analyzed further with pivot tables to identify significant relationships. These relationships were then used to create an interactive visualization dashboard that provides valuable insights and analysis. Some of these insights this project used to issue recommendations.

## Methodology
**Tools used:** Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, Google

### Methodology Process
**1. Data Transformation & Preparation:** Data collected was transformed and prepared in Microsoft Excel, where relevant metrics like revenue were calculated as well as date codes were clarified to be clearer text abbreviations. This was accomplished by using functions like TEXT and basic math operators. The Excel duplicate tool (Ctrl + D) was also essential for applying these transformations across thousands of rows.

**2. Drawing Data Relationships:** Next in Microsoft Excel pivot tables were created from the prepared data to highlight key relationships, such as transactions by hour and monthly gross revenue. For example, the monthly gross revenue table was generated by adding total revenue as a row and isolating months in a column, utilizing data from the preparation stage that previously had not existed.

**3. Visualizing Data:** Then the relationships identified in the pivot tables were visualized using appropriate Excel charts for clarity. For example, a line chart was used for monthly gross revenue, while a clustered column chart displayed monthly transaction counts. Excel’s formatting options were then utilized to enhanced chart readability.

**4. Creating the Dashboard:** These visualizations were then neatly organized to form an interactive dashboard utilizing a pivot table slicer so that deep and valuable insights can be made with little effort. For simplicity and viewability, all extra excel UI was disabled, such as gridlines and headers, to make the dashboard cleaner.

**5. Reporting:** Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint were used to report and present the project further in a way that is more fitting for their respective media forms.

## Insights & Recommendations

### Top 15 Product Types by Transactions

One major insight from the top product types table is that Scones, Premium brewers coffee, and Pastries are quite lucrative and have a great profit margin, despite lower sales compared to other products. This aligns with the niche market for Premium coffee. A good recommendation made from these insights is to focus on maintaining brand loyalty to keep these more price sensitive products at their steady rate or even increase their sales further.

### Gross Revenue by Month

A crucial insight from the data above is the steady revenue growth since February, peaking in June. This simple statistic is vital for measuring business success. All franchises show consistent growth without apparent outliers, suggesting the parent company is effectively marketing overall and the franchises are performing well.

### Gross Transactions by Hour

A slight anomaly is that the Astoria Manhattan location shows no sales at 8 PM (20 mt), likely due to its 7 AM closing time. However, this decision might have some great merit to it, as 8 PM sales are very rare, it is likely more economical to close earlier by avoiding things like extra wage costs. As such I recommend the other franchise locations consider closing before 8 pm as well.

## Project Conclusion 

This project successfully utilized the collected data on the Maven Roasters franchises’ sales to create a dashboard of useful insights and analysis based on relationships of relevant data from the set. I recommend closing at 8 PM to cut costs, continuing with the successful marketing strategy, and prioritizing brand loyalty and public relations to sustain or boost sales. The dashboard offers many more insights and recommendations to support these strategies.
